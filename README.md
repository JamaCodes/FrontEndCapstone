# Tell Em Why You Mad: The Information Dashboard

<!-- ## Setup: Follow these steps exactly

1. Clone this repository
1. `cd` into the directory it creates
1. In the `api` directory, create a copy of the `database.json.example` and remove the `.example` extension.
1. Run `json-server -p 8088 -w database.json` from the `api` directory. If you do not have json-server, install with `npm install json-server`.
1. Run `npm install` and wait for all dependencies to be installed.
1. Run `npm start` to verify that installation was successful.

> **Note:** Your `database.json` file is already in the `.gitignore` file for this project, so it will never be added to the repo or pushed to Github. -->

## What is Tell Em Why You Mad?

Tell Em Why You Mad is a new product offering that you have been tasked with building. It's an app for people to use to organize their daily tasks, events, news article, friends, and chat messages. Users can either log in or register, and then get started adding articles, tasks, events, and messages.

<!-- You will be using the React library to build out this application, and tailwind library to build out this application.

To start you off, here's an example of what some of the resources in your API should look like once it's populated with some data from your application. -->

<!-- ## A Note About Authentication

We want you to know that the login and registration code we have given you is fake, completely insecure, and would never be implemented in a professional application. It is a simulation authentication using very simplistic tools, because authentication is not a learning objective of students at NSS.

You will be using [session storage](https://javascript.info/localstorage#sessionstorage) to keep track of which user has logged into Nutshell. You need to read the code in the **`Login.js`** and **`Register.js`** components so that you see what is going on, but you do not need to change it.

## Keep in mind some tips for a good usable app
1. Use acceptable conventions
   * Logo positioned at top left
   * Navigation across the top or down the left side
2. Visual hierarchy
   * Most important information is the most prominent
3. Break pages up into defined sections
   * Logically related content should be related visually
4. That which is clickable should be obviously clickable.
5. Eliminate distractions
   * Use only two typefaces
   * Limit color pallet (3 colors with black and white)
   * Use a grid
6. Support scanning (users don't read)
   * Use plenty of headings
   * Short paragraphs
   * Bulleted lists
7. Strive for consistency. -->
